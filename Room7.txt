You find yourself walking into a scene where the cast of Monty
Python's Flying Circus is performing the "Crunchy Frog" sketch. You
see the confectioner as he replies, "If we took the bones out it
wouldn't be crunchy now, would it?" You see a box of "Crunchy Frog"
chocolates, the contents of which contains a dozen nicely cleaned
whole frogs that have been carefully hand-dipped in the finest
chocolate.
